# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## PagSeguro
### Overview and Origin
* PagSeguro was founded by its parent company Universo Online (UOL) in 2006 to provide the digital payment infrastructure for the burgeoning e-commerce sector of Brazil
* Between 2006-2011, 45% of Brazil's population had no bank account, and less than 30% had internet access. Yet UOL, the largest digital content, internet product and service provider in Brazil, saw the potential growth and knew that the expansion of internet users would beget a boom in the need for fast online payments
* Fastforward to 2022, and PagSeguro brings in 250 million (USD) annually in net income and offers an entire online banking ecosystem to its users. 


### Business Activities
* 10 years ago, the Brazillian retail landscape was a patchwork of micromerchants and small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) -- all with highly variable needs in terms of e-commerce and traditional POS methods.
* In 2013, PagSeguro expanded their services from online payments to POS devices and mobile POS (mPOS) for individual entrepreneurs, micromerchants, and SMEs. 
* Furthermore, instead of renting out their devices for monthly fees, they allowed these small businesses to finance and buy outright the units. While this prevented recurring revenues from device rental fees, it built a moat around their customer base that has proven resilient. 
* The progression from online payments to POS, then from POS to online banking, displays the organic and utilitarian purpose behind FinTech in many ways. They now have a single platform, PagBank, where merchants and consumers alike have access to free, scalable solutions. Onboarding requires no paperwork with a higher acceptance rate and lower fraud levels than that of card schemes.
* Merchants have 37 different cash-in options on their free platform, and consumers have access to QR code payment, peer-to-peer transfers, physical cash cards, along with multiple other features. 
* For small businesses, the PagBank app can generate income reports, allow them to receive advances on card receivable accounts, and even manage inventory.
